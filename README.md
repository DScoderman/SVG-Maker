this is a program that generates a scaled vector graphic(SVG)! The program currently generates simple SVG's to make a circle, square, or triangle. The program also lets you choose the color of the shape, allows for the input of 3 characters, and decide the color of your choice for the text. To ensure the program works, there is also test code via jest to help check if it works.
